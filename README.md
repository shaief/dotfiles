# finally dotfiles

This repo is here to help me in hard times, when i move to a new computer or accidently delete my configuration.

Let's start with .zshrc. To use it just clone this repo:
```
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/shaief/dotfiles.git
$ chmod u+x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

Good luck!
